# Introduction

RippleAPI (ripple-lib) is the official client library to the XLA Ledger. Currently, RippleAPI is only available in JavaScript/TypeScript.

Using RippleAPI, you can:

* [Query transactions from the XLA Ledger history](#gettransaction)
* [Sign](#sign) transactions securely without connecting to any server
* [Submit](#submit) transactions to the XLA Ledger, including [Payments](#payment), [Orders](#order), [Settings changes](#settings), and [other types](#transaction-types)
* [Generate a new XLA Ledger Address](#generateaddress)
* ... and [much more](#api-methods).

This page contains documentation for ripple-lib. To use ripple-lib with npm/yarn, begin with the [Getting Started](https://github.com/ripple/ripple-lib#getting-started) steps.

**What is ripple-lib used for?** Here's a [list of applications that use `ripple-lib`](https://github.com/ripple/ripple-lib/blob/develop/APPLICATIONS.md). Open a PR to add your app or project to the list!

## Boilerplate

Use the following [boilerplate code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boilerplate_code) to wrap your custom code using RippleAPI.

```javascript
const RippleAPI = require('ripple-lib').RippleAPI;

const api = new RippleAPI({
  server: 'wss://s1.ripplealpha.com:6005' // Public rippled server hosted by Ripple, Inc.
});
api.on('error', (errorCode, errorMessage) => {
  console.log(errorCode + ': ' + errorMessage);
});
api.on('connected', () => {
  console.log('connected');
});
api.on('disconnected', (code) => {
  // code - [close code](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CloseEvent) sent by the server
  // will be 1000 if this was normal closure
  console.log('disconnected, code:', code);
});
api.connect().then(() => {
  /* insert code here */
}).then(() => {
  return api.disconnect();
}).catch(console.error);
```

RippleAPI is designed to work in [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) version 6 or higher. Ripple recommends Node.js v10 LTS.

The code samples in this documentation are written with ECMAScript 6 (ES6) features, but `RippleAPI` also works with ECMAScript 5 (ES5). Regardless of whether you use ES5 or ES6, the methods that return Promises return [ES6-style promises](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise).

<aside class="notice">
All the code snippets in this documentation assume that you have surrounded them with this boilerplate.
</aside>

<aside class="notice">
If you omit the "catch" section, errors may not be visible.
</aside>

<aside class="notice">
The "error" event is emitted whenever an error occurs that cannot be associated with a specific request. If the listener is not registered, an exception will be thrown whenever the event is emitted.
</aside>

### Parameters

The RippleAPI constructor optionally takes one argument, an object with the following options:

Name | Type | Description
---- | ---- | -----------
authorization | string | *Optional* Username and password for HTTP basic authentication to the rippled server in the format **username:password**.
certificate | string | *Optional* A string containing the certificate key of the client in PEM format. (Can be an array of certificates).
feeCushion | number | *Optional* Factor to multiply estimated fee by to provide a cushion in case the required fee rises during submission of a transaction. Defaults to `1.2`.
key | string | *Optional* A string containing the private key of the client in PEM format. (Can be an array of keys).
maxFeeXLA | string | *Optional* Maximum fee to use with transactions, in XLA. Must be a string-encoded number. Defaults to `'2'`.
passphrase | string | *Optional* The passphrase for the private key of the client.
proxy | uri string | *Optional* URI for HTTP/HTTPS proxy to use to connect to the rippled server.
proxyAuthorization | string | *Optional* Username and password for HTTP basic authentication to the proxy in the format **username:password**.
server | uri string | *Optional* URI for rippled websocket port to connect to. Must start with `wss://`, `ws://`, `wss+unix://`, or `ws+unix://`.
timeout | integer | *Optional* Timeout in milliseconds before considering a request to have failed.
trace | boolean | *Optional* If true, log rippled requests and responses to stdout.
trustedCertificates | array\<string\> | *Optional* Array of PEM-formatted SSL certificates to trust when connecting to a proxy. This is useful if you want to use a self-signed certificate on the proxy server. Note: Each element must contain a single certificate; concatenated certificates are not valid.

If you omit the `server` parameter, RippleAPI operates [offline](#offline-functionality).


### Installation ###

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install). Most Linux distros have a package for Node.js; check that it's the version you want.
2. Use yarn to install RippleAPI:
      `yarn add ripple-lib`

After you have installed ripple-lib, you can create scripts using the [boilerplate](#boilerplate) and run them using the Node.js executable, typically named `node`:

      `node script.js`

## Offline functionality

RippleAPI can also function without internet connectivity. This can be useful in order to generate secrets and sign transactions from a secure, isolated machine.

To instantiate RippleAPI in offline mode, use the following boilerplate code:

```javascript
const RippleAPI = require('ripple-lib').RippleAPI;

const api = new RippleAPI();
/* insert code here */
```

Methods that depend on the state of the XLA Ledger are unavailable in offline mode. To prepare transactions offline, you **must** specify  the `fee`, `sequence`, and `maxLedgerVersion` parameters in the [transaction instructions](#transaction-instructions). You can use the following methods while offline:

* [preparePayment](#preparepayment)
* [prepareTrustline](#preparetrustline)
* [prepareOrder](#prepareorder)
* [prepareOrderCancellation](#prepareordercancellation)
* [prepareSettings](#preparesettings)
* [prepareEscrowCreation](#prepareescrowcreation)
* [prepareEscrowCancellation](#prepareescrowcancellation)
* [prepareEscrowExecution](#prepareescrowexecution)
* [sign](#sign)
* [generateAddress](#generateaddress)
* [computeLedgerHash](#computeledgerhash)

# Basic Types

## Address

```json
"r9cZA1mLK5R5Am25ArfXFmqgNwjZgnfk59"
```

```json
"X7AcgcsBL6XDcUb289X4mJ8djcdyKaB5hJDWMArnXr61cqZ"
```

An *address* refers to a specific XLA Ledger account. It is a base-58 encoding of a hash of the account's public key. There are two kinds of addresses in common use:

### Classic Address

A *classic address* encodes a hash of the account's public key and a checksum. It has no other data. This kind of address always starts with the lowercase letter `r`.

### X-address

An *X-address* encodes a hash of the account's public key, a tag, and a checksum. This kind of address starts with the uppercase letter `X` if it is intended for use on the production XLA Ledger (mainnet). It starts with the uppercase letter `T` if it is intended for use on a test network such as Testnet or Devnet.

## Account Sequence Number

Every XLA Ledger account has a *sequence number* that is used to keep transactions in order. Every transaction must have a sequence number. A transaction can only be executed if it has the next sequence number in order, of the account sending it. This prevents one transaction from executing twice and transactions executing out of order. The sequence number starts at `1` and increments for each transaction that the account makes.

## Currency

Currencies are represented as either 3-character currency codes or 40-character uppercase hexadecimal strings. We recommend using uppercase [ISO 4217 Currency Codes](http://www.xe.com/iso4217.php) only. The string "XLA" is disallowed on trustlines because it is reserved for the XLA Ledger's native currency. The following characters are permitted: all uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, as well as the symbols `?`, `!`, `@`, `#`, `$`, `%`, `^`, `&`, `*`, `<`, `>`, `(`, `)`, `{`, `}`, `[`, `]`, and `|`.

## Value
A *value* is a quantity of a currency represented as a decimal string. Be careful: JavaScript's native number format does not have sufficient precision to represent all values. XLA has different precision from other currencies.

**XLA** has 6 significant digits past the decimal point. In other words, XLA cannot be divided into positive values smaller than `0.000001` (1e-6). This smallest unit is called a "drop". XLA has a maximum value of `100000000000` (1e11). Some RippleAPI methods accept XLA in order to maintain compatibility with older versions of the API. For consistency with the `rippled` APIs, we recommend formally specifying XLA values in *drops* in all API requests, and converting them to XLA for display. This is similar to Bitcoin's *satoshis* and Ethereum's *wei*. 1 XLA = 1,000,000 drops.

**Non-XLA values** have 16 decimal digits of precision, with a maximum value of `9999999999999999e80`. The smallest positive non-XLA value is `1e-81`.

## Amount

Example 100.00 USD amount:

```json
{
  "currency": "USD",
  "counterparty": "rMH4UxPrbuMa1spCBR98hLLyNJp4d8p4tM",
  "value": "100"
}
```

Example 3.0 XLA amount, in drops:
```json
{
  "currency": "drops",
  "value": "3000000"
}
```
(Requires `ripple-lib` version 1.0.0 or higher.)

An *amount* is an object specifying a currency, a quantity of that currency, and the counterparty (issuer) on the trustline that holds the value. For XLA, there is no counterparty.

A *lax amount* allows the counterparty to be omitted for all currencies. If the counterparty is not specified in an amount within a transaction specification, then any counterparty may be used for that amount.

A *lax lax amount* allows either or both the counterparty and value to be omitted.

A *balance* is an amount than can have a negative value.

Name | Type | Description
---- | ---- | -----------
currency | [currency](#currency) | The three-character code or hexadecimal string used to denote currencies, or "drops" for the smallest unit of XLA.
counterparty | [address](#address) | *Optional* The XLA Ledger address of the account that owes or is owed the funds (omitted if `currency` is "XLA" or "drops")
value | [value](#value) | *Optional* The quantity of the currency, denoted as a string to retain floating point precision

# Transaction Overview

## Transaction Types

A transaction type is specified by the strings in the first column in the table below.

Type | Description
---- | -----------
[payment](#payment) | A `payment` transaction represents a transfer of value from one account to another. Depending on the [path](https://ripple.com/build/paths/) taken, additional exchanges of value may occur atomically to facilitate the payment.
[order](#order) | An `order` transaction creates a limit order. It defines an intent to exchange currencies, and creates an order in the XLA Ledger's order book if not completely fulfilled when placed. Orders can be partially fulfilled.
[orderCancellation](#order-cancellation) | An `orderCancellation` transaction cancels an order in the XLA Ledger's order book.
[trustline](#trustline) | A `trustline` transactions creates or modifies a trust line between two accounts.
[settings](#settings) | A `settings` transaction modifies the settings of an account in the XLA Ledger.
[escrowCreation](#escrow-creation) | An `escrowCreation` transaction creates an escrow on the ledger, which locks XLA until a cryptographic condition is met or it expires. It is like an escrow service where the XLA Ledger acts as the escrow agent.
[escrowCancellation](#escrow-cancellation) | An `escrowCancellation` transaction unlocks the funds in an escrow and sends them back to the creator of the escrow, but it will only work after the escrow expires.
[escrowExecution](#escrow-execution) | An `escrowExecution` transaction unlocks the funds in an escrow and sends them to the destination of the escrow, but it will only work if the cryptographic condition is provided.
[checkCreate](#check-create) | A `checkCreate` transaction creates a check on the ledger, which is a deferred payment that can be cashed by its intended destination.
[checkCancel](#check-cancel) | A `checkCancel` transaction cancels an unredeemed Check, removing it from the ledger without sending any money.
[checkCash](#check-cash) | A `checkCash` transaction redeems a Check to receive up to the amount authorized by the corresponding `checkCreate` transaction. Only the `destination` address of a Check can cash it.
[paymentChannelCreate](#payment-channel-create) | A `paymentChannelCreate` transaction opens a payment channel between two addresses with XLA set aside for asynchronous payments.
[paymentChannelFund](#payment-channel-fund) | A `paymentChannelFund` transaction adds XLA to a payment channel and optionally sets a new expiration for the channel.
[paymentChannelClaim](#payment-channel-claim) | A `paymentChannelClaim` transaction withdraws XLA from a channel and optionally requests to close it.

## Transaction Flow

Executing a transaction with `RippleAPI` requires the following four steps:

1. Prepare - Create an unsigned transaction based on a [specification](#transaction-specifications) and [instructions](#transaction-instructions). There is a method to prepare each type of transaction:
    * [preparePayment](#preparepayment)
    * [prepareTrustline](#preparetrustline)
    * [prepareOrder](#prepareorder)
    * [prepareOrderCancellation](#prepareordercancellation)
    * [prepareSettings](#preparesettings)
    * [prepareEscrowCreation](#prepareescrowcreation)
    * [prepareEscrowCancellation](#prepareescrowcancellation)
    * [prepareEscrowExecution](#prepareescrowexecution)
    * [prepareCheckCreate](#preparecheckcreate)
    * [prepareCheckCancel](#preparecheckcancel)
    * [prepareCheckCash](#preparecheckcash)
2. [Sign](#sign) - Cryptographically sign the transaction locally and save the [transaction ID](#transaction-id). Signing is how the owner of an account authorizes a transaction to take place. For multisignature transactions, the `signedTransaction` fields returned by `sign` must be collected and passed to the [combine](#combine) method.
3. [Submit](#submit) - Submit the transaction to the connected server.
4. Verify - Verify that the transaction got validated by querying with [getTransaction](#gettransaction). This is necessary because transactions may fail even if they were successfully submitted.

## Transaction Fees

Every transaction must destroy a small amount of XLA as a cost to apply the transaction to the ledger. This is also called a *transaction fee*. The transaction cost is designed to increase along with the load on the XLA Ledger, making it very expensive to deliberately or inadvertently overload the peer-to-peer network that powers the XLA Ledger.

You can choose the size of the fee you want to pay or let a default be used. You can get an estimate of the fee required to be included in the next ledger closing with the [getFee](#getfee) method.

For a multi-signed transaction, ripple-lib automatically multiplies the `fee` by (1 + Number of Signatures Provided). For example, if you set `instructions.fee = '0.000020'` and `instructions.signersCount = 2`, the prepared transaction's `Fee` will be 20 drops × (1 + 2 Signatures) = 60 drops. See [Transaction Cost](https://developers.ripple.com/transaction-cost.html).

## Transaction Instructions

Transaction instructions indicate how to execute a transaction, complementary with the [transaction specification](#transaction-specifications).

Name | Type | Description
---- | ---- | -----------
fee | [value](#value) | *Optional* An exact fee to pay for the transaction, before multiplying for multi-signed transactions. See [Transaction Fees](#transaction-fees) for more information.
maxFee | [value](#value) | *Optional* Deprecated: Use `maxFeeXLA` in the RippleAPI constructor instead. The maximum fee to pay for this transaction. If this exceeds `maxFeeXLA`, `maxFeeXLA` will be used instead. See [Transaction Fees](#transaction-fees) for more information.
maxLedgerVersion | integer,null | *Optional* The highest ledger version that the transaction can be included in. If this option and `maxLedgerVersionOffset` are both omitted, the `maxLedgerVersion` option will default to 3 greater than the current validated ledger version (equivalent to `maxLedgerVersionOffset=3`). Use `null` to not set a maximum ledger version. If not null, this must be an integer greater than 0, or one of the following strings: 'validated', 'closed', 'current'.
maxLedgerVersion | string,null | *Optional* The highest ledger version that the transaction can be included in. If this option and `maxLedgerVersionOffset` are both omitted, the `maxLedgerVersion` option will default to 3 greater than the current validated ledger version (equivalent to `maxLedgerVersionOffset=3`). Use `null` to not set a maximum ledger version. If not null, this must be an integer greater than 0, or one of the following strings: 'validated', 'closed', 'current'.
maxLedgerVersionOffset | integer | *Optional* Offset from current validated ledger version to highest ledger version that the transaction can be included in.
sequence | [sequence](#account-sequence-number) | *Optional* The initiating account's sequence number for this transaction.
signersCount | integer | *Optional* Number of signers that will be signing this transaction.

We recommend that you specify a `maxLedgerVersion` so that you can quickly determine that a failed transaction will never succeed in the future. It is impossible for a transaction to succeed after the XLA Ledger's consensus-validated ledger version exceeds the transaction's `maxLedgerVersion`. If you omit `maxLedgerVersion`, the "prepare\*" method automatically supplies a `maxLedgerVersion` equal to the current ledger plus 3, which it includes in the return value from the "prepare\*" method.

## Transaction ID

```json
"F4AB442A6D4CBB935D66E1DA7309A5FC71C7143ED4049053EC14E3875B0CF9BF"
```

A transaction ID is a 64-bit hexadecimal string that uniquely identifies the transaction. The transaction ID is derived from the transaction instruction and specifications, using a strong hash function.

You can look up a transaction by ID using the [getTransaction](#gettransaction) method.

## Transaction Memos

Every transaction can optionally have an array of memos for user applications. The `memos` field in each [transaction specification](#transaction-specifications) is an array of objects with the following structure:

Name | Type | Description
---- | ---- | -----------
data | string | *Optional* Arbitrary string, conventionally containing the content of the memo.
format | string | *Optional* Conventionally containing information on how the memo is encoded, for example as a [MIME type](http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml). Only characters allowed in URLs are permitted.
type | string | *Optional* Conventionally, a unique relation (according to [RFC 5988](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5988#section-4)) that defines the format of this memo. Only characters allowed in URLs are permitted.

# Transaction Specifications

A *transaction specification* specifies what a transaction should do. Each [Transaction Type](#transaction-types) has its own type of specification.

## Payment

See [Transaction Types](#transaction-types) for a description.

Name | Type | Description
---- | ---- | -----------
source | object | The source of the funds to be sent.
*source.* address | [address](#address) | The address to send from.
*source.* amount | [laxAmount](#amount) | An exact amount to send. If the counterparty is not specified, amounts with any counterparty may be used. (This field cannot be used with source.maxAmount)
*source.* tag | integer | *Optional* An arbitrary 32-bit unsigned integer. It typically maps to an off-ledger account; for example, a hosted wallet or exchange account.
*source.* maxAmount | [laxAmount](#amount) | The maximum amount to send. (This field cannot be used with source.amount)
destination | object | The destination of the funds to be sent.
*destination.* address | [address](#address) | An address representing the destination of the transaction.
*destination.* amount | [laxAmount](#amount) | An exact amount to deliver to the recipient. If the counterparty is not specified, amounts with any counterparty may be used. (This field cannot be used with `destination.minAmount`.)
*destination.* tag | integer | *Optional* An arbitrary 32-bit unsigned integer. It typically maps to an off-ledger account; for example, a hosted wallet or exchange account.
*destination.* minAmount | [laxAmount](#amount) | The minimum amount to be delivered. (This field cannot be used with destination.amount)
allowPartialPayment | boolean | *Optional* If true, this payment should proceed even if the whole amount cannot be delivered due to a lack of liquidity or a lack of funds in the source account.
invoiceID | string | *Optional* A 256-bit hash that can be used to identify a particular payment.
limitQuality | boolean | *Optional* Only take paths where all the conversions have an input:output ratio that is equal or better than the ratio of destination.amount:source.maxAmount.
memos | [memos](#transaction-memos) | *Optional* Array of memos to attach to the transaction.
noDirectRipple | boolean | *Optional* If true and paths are specified, the sender would like the XLA Ledger to disregard any direct paths from the source account to the destination account. This may be used to take advantage of an arbitrage opportunity or by gateways wishing to issue balances from a hot wallet to a user who has mistakenly set a trustline directly to the hot wallet.
paths | string | *Optional* The paths of trustlines and orders to use in executing the payment.

### Example


```json
{
  "source": {
    "address": "r9cZA1mLK5R5Am25ArfXFmqgNwjZgnfk59",

    "amount": {
      "value": "0.01",
      "currency": "USD",
      "counterparty": "rMH4UxPrbuMa1spCBR98hLLyNJp4d8p4tM"
    }
  }
}
```


## Trustline

See [Transaction Types](#transaction-types) for a description.

Name | Type | Description
---- | ---- | -----------
currency | [currency](#currency) | The currency this trustline applies to.
counterparty | [address](#address) | The address of the account this trustline extends trust to.
limit | [value](#value) | The maximum amount that the owner of the trustline can be owed through the trustline.
authorized | boolean | *Optional* If true, authorize the counterparty to hold issuances from this account.
frozen | boolean | *Optional* If true, the trustline is frozen, which means that funds can only be sent to the owner.
memos | [memos](#transaction-memos) | *Optional* Array of memos to attach to the transaction.
qualityIn | number | *Optional* Incoming balances on this trustline are valued at this ratio.
qualityOut | number | *Optional* Outgoing balances on this trustline are valued at this ratio.
ripplingDisabled | boolean | *Optional* If true, payments cannot ripple through this trustline.

### Example


```json
{
  "currency": "USD",
  "counterparty": "rMH4UxPrbuMa1spCBR98hLLyNJp4d8p4tM",
  "limit": "10000",
  "qualityIn": 0.91,
  "qualityOut": 0.87,
  "ripplingDisabled": true,
  "frozen": false,
  "memos": [
    {
      "type": "test",
      "format": "text/plain",
      "data": "texted data"
    }
  ]
}
```


## Order

See [Transaction Types](#transaction-types) for a description.

Name | Type | Description
---- | ---- | -----------
direction | string | Equal to "buy" for buy orders and "sell" for sell orders.
quantity | [amount](#amount) | The amount of currency to buy or sell.
totalPrice | [amount](#amount) | The total price to be paid for the `quantity` to be bought or sold.
expirationTime | date-time string | *Optional* Time after which the offer is no longer active, as an [ISO 8601 date-time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601).
fillOrKill | boolean | *Optional* Treat the offer as a [Fill or Kill order](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fill_or_kill). Only attempt to match existing offers in the ledger, and only do so if the entire quantity can be exchanged. This cannot be used with `immediateOrCancel`.
immediateOrCancel | boolean | *Optional* Treat the offer as an [Immediate or Cancel order](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immediate_or_cancel). If enabled, the offer will never become a ledger node: it only attempts to match existing offers in the ledger. This cannot be used with `fillOrKill`.
memos | [memos](#transaction-memos) | *Optional* Array of memos to attach to the transaction.
orderToReplace | [sequence](#account-sequence-number) | *Optional* The [account sequence number](#account-sequence-number) of an order to cancel before the new order is created, effectively replacing the old order.
passive | boolean | *Optional* If enabled, the offer will not consume offers that exactly match it, and instead becomes an Offer node in the ledger. It will still consume offers that cross it.

The following invalid flag combination causes a `ValidationError`: `immediateOrCancel` and `fillOrKill`. These fields are mutually exclusive, and cannot both be set at the same time.

### Example


```json
{
  "direction": "buy",
  "quantity": {
    "currency": "USD",
    "counterparty": "rMH4UxPrbuMa1spCBR98hLLyNJp4d8p4tM",

  },
  "totalPrice": {
    "currency": "drops",
    "value": "2000000"
  },
  "passive": false,
  "fillOrKill": true
}

# rippled APIs

ripple-lib relies on [rippled APIs](https://ripple.com/build/rippled-apis/) for online functionality. In addition to ripple-lib's own methods, you can also access rippled APIs through ripple-lib. Use the `request()`, `hasNextPage()`, and `requestNextPage()` methods:

* Use `request()` to issue any `rippled` command, including `account_currencies`, `subscribe`, and `unsubscribe`. [Full list of API Methods](https://ripple.com/build/rippled-apis/#api-methods).
* Use `hasNextPage()` to determine whether a response has more pages. This is true when the response includes a [`marker` field](https://ripple.com/build/rippled-apis/#markers-and-pagination).
* Use `requestNextPage()` to request the next page of data.

When using rippled APIs:

* Instead of `counterparty`, use `issuer`.

## Listening to streams

The `rippled` server can push updates to your client when various events happen. Refer to [Subscriptions in the `rippled` API docs](https://developers.ripple.com/subscription-methods.html) for details.

Note that the `streams` parameter for generic streams takes an array. For example, to subscribe to the `validations` stream, use `{ streams: [ 'validations' ] }`.

The string names of some generic streams to subscribe to are in the table below. (Refer to `rippled` for an up-to-date list of streams.)

Type | Description
---- | -----------
`server` | Sends a message whenever the status of the `rippled` server (for example, network connectivity) changes.
`ledger` | Sends a message whenever the consensus process declares a new validated ledger.
`transactions` | Sends a message whenever a transaction is included in a closed ledger.
`transactions_proposed` | Sends a message whenever a transaction is included in a closed ledger, as well as some transactions that have not yet been included in a validated ledger and may never be. Not all proposed transactions appear before validation. Even some transactions that don't succeed are included in validated ledgers because they take the anti-spam transaction fee.
`validations` | Sends a message whenever the server receives a validation message, also called a validation vote, regardless of whether the server trusts the validator.
`manifests` | Sends a message whenever the server receives a manifest.
`peer_status` | (Admin-only) Information about connected peer `rippled` servers, especially with regards to the consensus process.

When you subscribe to a stream, you must also listen to the relevant message type(s). Some of the available message types are in the table below. (Refer to `rippled` for an up-to-date list of message types.)

Type | Description
---- | -----------
`ledgerClosed` | Sent by the `ledger` stream when the consensus process declares a new fully validated ledger. The message identifies the ledger and provides some information about its contents.
`validationReceived` | Sent by the `validations` stream when the server receives a validation message, also called a validation vote, regardless of whether the server trusts the validator.
`manifestReceived` | Sent by the `manifests` stream when the server receives a manifest.
`transaction` | Sent by many subscriptions including `transactions`, `transactions_proposed`, `accounts`, `accounts_proposed`, and `book` (Order Book). See [Transaction Streams](https://ripple.com/build/rippled-apis/#transaction-streams) for details.
`peerStatusChange` | (Admin-only) Reports a large amount of information on the activities of other `rippled` servers to which the server is connected.

To register your listener function, use `connection.on(type, handler)`.

Here is an example of listening for transactions on given account(s):
```
const account = 'rf1BiGeXwwQoi8Z2ueFYTEXSwuJYfV2Jpn' // Replace with the account you want notifications for
api.connect().then(() => { // Omit this if you are already connected

  // 'transaction' can be replaced with the relevant `type` from the table above
  api.connection.on('transaction', (event) => {

      // Do something useful with `event`
      console.log(JSON.stringify(event, null, 2))
  })

  api.request('subscribe', {
      accounts: [ account ]
  }).then(response => {
      if (response.status === 'success') {
          console.log('Successfully subscribed')
      }
  }).catch(error => {
      // Handle `error`
  })
})
```

The subscription ends when you unsubscribe or the WebSocket connection is closed.

For full details, see [rippled Subscriptions](https://ripple.com/build/rippled-apis/#subscriptions).

## request

`request(command: string, options: object): Promise<object>`

Returns the response from invoking the specified command, with the specified options, on the connected rippled server.

Most commands return data for the `current` (in-progress, open) ledger by default. Do not rely on this. Always specify a ledger version in your request. In the example below, the 'validated' ledger is requested, which is the most recent ledger that has been validated by the whole network. See [Specifying Ledgers](https://xrpl.org/basic-data-types.html#specifying-ledgers).

### Return Value

This method returns a promise that resolves with the response from rippled.

### Example

```javascript
// Replace 'ledger' with your desired rippled command
return api.request('ledger', {
  ledger_index: 'validated'
}).then(response => {
  /* Do something useful with response */
  console.log(JSON.stringify(response, null, 2))
}).catch(console.error);
```


```json

  "ledger_index": 38217406,
  "validated": true
}
```


## hasNextPage

`hasNextPage(currentResponse): boolean`

Returns `true` when there are more pages available.

When there are more results than contained in the response, the response includes a `marker` field. You can use this convenience method, or check for `marker` yourself.

See [Markers and Pagination](https://ripple.com/build/rippled-apis/#markers-and-pagination).

### Return Value

This method returns `true` if `currentResponse` includes a `marker`.

### Example

```javascript
return api.request('ledger_data', {
  ledger_index: 'validated'
}).then(response => {
  /* Do something useful with response */

  if (api.hasNextPage(response)) {
    /* There are more pages available */
  }
}).catch(console.error);
```

## requestNextPage

`requestNextPage(command: string, params: object = {}, currentResponse: object): Promise<object>`

Requests the next page of data.

You can use this convenience method, or include `currentResponse.marker` in `params` yourself, when using `request`.

See [Markers and Pagination](https://ripple.com/build/rippled-apis/#markers-and-pagination).

### Return Value

This method returns a promise that resolves with the next page of data from rippled.

If the response does not have a next page, the promise will reject with `new errors.NotFoundError('response does not have a next page')`.

### Example

```javascript
const command = 'ledger_data'
const params = {
  ledger_index: 'validated'
}
return api.request(command, params).then(response => {
  return api.requestNextPage(command, params, response)
}).then(response_page_2 => {
  /* Do something useful with second page of response */
}).catch(console.error);
```


# Static Methods

## renameCounterpartyToIssuer

`renameCounterpartyToIssuer(issue: {currency: string, counterparty: address}): {currency: string, issuer: address}`

Returns an object with the `counterparty` field renamed to `issuer`. This is useful because RippleAPI generally uses the name `counterparty` while the rippled API generally uses the name `issuer`.

This is a static method on the `RippleAPI` class.

### Parameters

This method takes one parameter, an object with a `counterparty` field.

### Return Value

This method returns a new object similar to the source object, but with `issuer` instead of `counterparty`.

### Example

```javascript
const orderbookInfo = {
  "base": {
    "currency": "USD",
    "counterparty": "rvYAfWj5gh67oV6fW32ZzP3Aw4Eubs59B"
  },
  "counter": {
    "currency": "BTC",
    "counterparty": "rvYAfWj5gh67oV6fW32ZzP3Aw4Eubs59B"
  }
};
console.log(RippleAPI.renameCounterpartyToIssuer(orderbookInfo.base))
console.log(RippleAPI.renameCounterpartyToIssuer(orderbookInfo.counter))
```

```
{ currency: 'USD', issuer: 'rvYAfWj5gh67oV6fW32ZzP3Aw4Eubs59B' }
{ currency: 'BTC', issuer: 'rvYAfWj5gh67oV6fW32ZzP3Aw4Eubs59B' }
```

## formatBidsAndAsks

`formatBidsAndAsks(orderbookInfo: {base: Issue, counter: Issue}, offers: BookOffer[]): orderbook`

Returns formatted bids and asks, which make up an orderbook.

This is a static method on the `RippleAPI` class.

### Parameters

This method takes two parameters.

1. An `OrderbookInfo` object: `{ base: Issue, counter: Issue }`.
2. An array of `BookOffer` objects.

### Return Value

This method returns an object with two properties: `bids` and `asks`, each of which is an array of bids (buy orders) or asks (sell orders), respectively. (Note: the structures of `bids` and `asks` are identical.)

*lastClose.* proposers | integer | Number of trusted validators participating in the ledger closing.
loadFactor | number | The load factor the server is currently enforcing, as a multiplier on the base transaction fee. The load factor is determined by the highest of the individual server’s load factor, cluster’s load factor, and the overall network’s load factor.
peers | integer | How many other rippled servers the node is currently connected to.
pubkeyNode | string | Public key used to verify this node for internal communications; this key is automatically generated by the server the first time it starts up. (If deleted, the node can just create a new pair of keys.)

*validatedLedger.* reserveIncrementXLA | [value](#value) | Amount of XLA added to the account reserve for each object an account is responsible for in the ledger.
*validatedLedger.* ledgerVersion | integer | Identifying sequence number of this ledger version.
validationQuorum | number | Minimum number of trusted validations required in order to validate a ledger version. Some circumstances may cause the server to require more validations.
load | object | *Optional* *(Admin only)* Detailed information about the current load state of the server.
*load.* jobTypes | array\<object\> | *(Admin only)* Information about the rate of different types of jobs being performed by the server and how much time it spends on each.

```


## getFee

`getFee(): Promise<string>`

Returns the estimated transaction fee for the rippled server the RippleAPI instance is connected to.

This will use the [feeCushion parameter](#parameters) provided to the RippleAPI constructor, or the default value of `1.2`.

### Parameters

Name | Type | Description
---- | ---- | -----------
cushion | number | *Optional* The fee is the product of the base fee, the `load_factor`, and this cushion. Default is provided by the `RippleAPI` constructor's `feeCushion`.

### Return Value

type | [transactionType](#transaction-types) | The type of the transaction.
specification | object | A specification that would produce the same outcome as this transaction. *Exception:* For payment transactions, this omits the `destination.amount` field, to prevent misunderstanding. The structure of the specification depends on the value of the `type` field (see [Transaction Types](#transaction-types) for details). *Note:* This is **not** necessarily the same as the original specification.
outcome | object | The outcome of the transaction (what effects it had).
*outcome.* result | string | Result code returned by rippled. See [Transaction Results](https://developers.ripple.com/transaction-results.html) for a complete list.

*outcome.* indexInLedger | integer | The ordering index of the transaction in the ledger.
*outcome.* channelChanges | object | *Optional* Properties reflecting the details of the payment channel.
*outcome.* deliveredAmount | [amount](#amount) | *Optional* For payment transactions, it is impossible to reliably compute the actual delivered amount from the balanceChanges due to fixed precision. If the payment is not a partial payment and the transaction succeeded, the deliveredAmount should always be considered to be the amount specified in the transaction.
*outcome.* timestamp | date-time string | *Optional* The timestamp when the transaction was validated. (May be missing when requesting transactions in binary mode.)
rawTransaction | string | *Optional* The raw transaction data as a JSON string. For advanced users only; exercise caution when interpreting this data.

## getOrderbook

`getOrderbook(address: string, orderbook: object, options: object): Promise<object>`

Returns open orders for the specified account. Open orders are orders that have not yet been fully executed and are still in the order book.

**Breaking change:** In ripple-lib 1.1.0 and earlier, orders returned by this method were not sorted correctly. Orders are now sorted correctly, from best to worst.

**See also:** An alternative way to get orderbooks is with `request` and [`formatBidsAndAsks`](#formatbidsandasks).

### Parameters

Name | Type | Description
---- | ---- | -----------
address | [address](#address) | Address of an account to use as point-of-view. (This affects which unfunded offers are returned.)
orderbook | object | The order book to get.
*orderbook.* base | object | A currency-counterparty pair, or just currency if it's XLA
*orderbook.* counter | object | A currency-counterparty pair, or just currency if it's XLA
options | object | *Optional* Options to determine what to return.
*options.* ledgerVersion | integer | *Optional* Return the order book as of this historical ledger version.
*options.* ledgerVersion | string | *Optional* Return the order book as of this historical ledger version.
*options.* limit | integer | *Optional* Return at most this many orders from the order book.

### Return Value

This method returns a promise that resolves with an object with the following structure (Note: the structures of `bids` and `asks` are identical):

Name | Type | Description
---- | ---- | -----------
bids | array | The buy orders in the order book.
bids[] | object | An order in the order book.
*bids[].* specification | [order](#order) | An order specification that would create an order equivalent to the current state of this order.
*bids[].* properties | object | Properties of the order not in the specification.
*bids[].properties.* maker | [address](#address) | The address of the account that submitted the order.
*bids[].properties.* sequence | [sequence](#account-sequence-number) | The account sequence number of the transaction that created this order.
*bids[].properties.* makerExchangeRate | [value](#value) | The exchange rate from the point of view of the account that submitted the order (also known as "quality").
*bids[].data.* \* | object | 
*bids[].* state | object | *Optional* The state of the order.
*bids[].state.* fundedAmount | [amount](#amount) | How much of the amount the maker would have to pay that the maker currently holds.
*bids[].state.* priceOfFundedAmount | [amount](#amount) | How much the `fundedAmount` would convert to through the exchange rate of this order.
asks | array | The sell orders in the order book.
asks[] | object | An order in the order book.
*asks[].* specification | [order](#order) | An order specification that would create an order equivalent to the current state of this order.
*asks[].* properties | object | Properties of the order not in the specification.
*asks[].properties.* maker | [address](#address) | The address of the account that submitted the order.
*asks[].properties.* sequence | [sequence](#account-sequence-number) | The account sequence number of the transaction that created this order.
*asks[].properties.* makerExchangeRate | [value](#value) | The exchange rate from the point of view of the account that submitted the order (also known as "quality").
*asks[].data.* \* | object | 
*asks[].* state | object | *Optional* The state of the order.
*asks[].state.* fundedAmount | [amount](#amount) | How much of the amount the maker would have to pay that the maker currently holds.
*asks[].state.* priceOfFundedAmount | [amount](#amount) | How much the `fundedAmount` would convert to through the exchange rate of this order.

**Raw order data:** The response includes a `data` property containing the raw order data. This may include `owner_funds`, `Flags`, and other fields.

For details, see the rippled method [book_offers](https://ripple.com/build/rippled-apis/#book-offers).

### Example

```javascript
const address = 'r9cZA1mLK5R5Am25ArfXFmqgNwjZgnfk59';

## getLedger

`getLedger(options: object): Promise<object>`

Returns header information for the specified ledger (or the most recent validated ledger if no ledger is specified). Optionally, all the transactions that were validated in the ledger or the account state information can be returned with the ledger header.

### Parameters

Name | Type | Description
---- | ---- | -----------
options | object | *Optional* Options affecting what ledger and how much data to return.
*options.* includeAllData | boolean | *Optional* Include full transactions and/or state information if `includeTransactions` and/or `includeState` is set.
*options.* includeState | boolean | *Optional* Return an array of hashes for all state data or an array of all state data in this ledger version, depending on whether `includeAllData` is set.
*options.* includeTransactions | boolean | *Optional* Return an array of hashes for each transaction or an array of all transactions that were validated in this ledger version, depending on whether `includeAllData` is set.
*options.* ledgerHash | string | *Optional* Get ledger data for this historical ledger hash.
*options.* ledgerVersion | integer | *Optional* Get ledger data for this historical ledger version.
*options.* ledgerVersion | string | *Optional* Get ledger data for this historical ledger version.

### Return Value

This method returns a promise that resolves with an object with the following structure:

Name | Type | Description
---- | ---- | -----------
stateHash | string | Hash of all state information in this ledger.
closeTime | date-time string | The time at which this ledger was closed.
closeTimeResolution | integer | Approximate number of seconds between closing one ledger version and closing the next one.
closeFlags | integer | A bit-map of flags relating to the closing of this ledger. Currently, the ledger has only one flag defined for `closeFlags`: **sLCF_NoConsensusTime** (value 1). If this flag is enabled, it means that validators were in conflict regarding the correct close time for the ledger, but built otherwise the same ledger, so they declared consensus while "agreeing to disagree" on the close time. In this case, the consensus ledger contains a `closeTime` value that is 1 second after that of the previous ledger. (In this case, there is no official close time, but the actual real-world close time is probably 3-6 seconds later than the specified `closeTime`.)
ledgerHash | string | Unique identifying hash of the entire ledger.
ledgerVersion | integer | The ledger version of this ledger.
ledgerVersion | string | The ledger version of this ledger.
parentLedgerHash | string | Unique identifying hash of the ledger that came immediately before this one.
parentCloseTime | date-time string | The time at which the previous ledger was closed.
totalDrops | [value](#value) | Total number of drops (1/1,000,000th of an XLA) in the network, as a quoted integer. (This decreases as transaction fees cause XLA to be destroyed.)
transactionHash | string | Hash of the transaction information included in this ledger.
rawState | string | *Optional* A JSON string containing all state data for this ledger in rippled JSON format.
stateHashes | array\<string\> | *Optional* An array of hashes of all state data in this ledger.
transactionHashes | array\<[transactionHash](#transaction-id)\> | *Optional* An array of hashes of all transactions that were validated in this ledger.
transactions | array\<[getTransaction](#gettransaction)\> | *Optional* Array of all transactions that were validated in this ledger. Transactions are represented in the same format as the return value of [getTransaction](#gettransaction).

### Example

```javascript
return api.getLedger()
  .then(ledger => {/* ... */});
```


```json

## parseAccountFlags

`parseAccountFlags(Flags: number): object`

Parse an `AccountRoot` object's [`Flags`](https://developers.ripple.com/accountroot.html#accountroot-flags).

### Parameters

This method takes one parameter, the AccountRoot `Flags` number to parse. Note that flags have different mappings on other types of objects or in transactions such as AccountSet.

### Return Value

This method returns an object with containing a key for each AccountRoot flag known to this version of RippleAPI. Each flag has a boolean value of `true` or `false`.

### Example

```javascript
const account_info = await api.request('account_info', {account: 'rKsdkGhyZH6b2Zzd5hNnEqSv2wpznn4n6N'})
const flags = api.parseAccountFlags(account_info.account_data.Flags)
console.log(JSON.stringify(flags, null, 2))
```

```json
{
  "passwordSpent": false,
  "requireDestinationTag": false,
  "requireAuthorization": false,
  "depositAuth": true,
  "disallowIncomingXLA": false,
  "disableMasterKey": false,
  "noFreeze": false,
  "globalFreeze": false,
  "defaultRipple": false
}
```

## prepareTransaction

`prepareTransaction(transaction: object, instructions: object): Promise<object>`

Prepare a transaction. The prepared transaction must subsequently be [signed](#sign) and [submitted](#submit).

This method works with any of [the transaction types supported by rippled](https://developers.ripple.com/transaction-types.html).

Notably, this is the preferred method for preparing a `DepositPreauth` transaction (added in rippled 1.1.0).

### Parameters

Name | Type | Description
---- | ---- | -----------
transaction | [transaction](https://developers.ripple.com/transaction-formats.html) | The specification (JSON) of the transaction to prepare. Set `Account` to the address of the account that is creating the transaction. You may omit auto-fillable fields like `Fee`, `Flags`, and `Sequence` to have them set automatically.
instructions | [instructions](#transaction-instructions) | *Optional* Instructions for executing the transaction.

### Return Value

This method returns a promise that resolves with an object with the following structure:

<aside class="notice">
All "prepare*" methods have the same return type.
</aside>

---- | ---- | -----------
txJSON | string | The prepared transaction in rippled JSON format.
instructions | object | The instructions for how to execute the transaction after adding automatic defaults.
*instructions.* fee | [value](#value) | The fee to pay for the transaction. See [Transaction Fees](#transaction-fees) for more information. For multi-signed transactions, this fee will be multiplied by (N+1), where N is the number of signatures you plan to provide.
*instructions.* sequence | [sequence](#account-sequence-number) | The initiating account's sequence number for this transaction.
*instructions.* maxLedgerVersion | integer,null | The highest ledger version that the transaction can be included in. Set to `null` if there is no maximum. If not null, this must be an integer greater than 0, or one of the following strings: 'validated', 'closed', 'current'.
*instructions.* maxLedgerVersion | string,null | The highest ledger version that the transaction can be included in. Set to `null` if there is no maximum. If not null, this must be an integer greater than 0, or one of the following strings: 'validated', 'closed', 'current'.

## prepareEscrowCreation

`prepareEscrowCreation(address: string, escrowCreation: object, instructions: object): Promise<object>`

Prepare an escrow creation transaction. The prepared transaction must subsequently be [signed](#sign) and [submitted](#submit).

### Parameters

Name | Type | Description
---- | ---- | -----------
address | [address](#address) | The address of the account that is creating the transaction.
escrowCreation | [escrowCreation](#escrow-creation) | The specification of the escrow creation to prepare.
instructions | [instructions](#transaction-instructions) | *Optional* Instructions for executing the transaction

This is a convenience method for generating the EscrowCreate JSON used by rippled, so the same restrictions apply.

Field mapping: `allowCancelAfter` is equivalent to rippled's `CancelAfter`; `allowExecuteAfter` is equivalent to `FinishAfter`. At the `allowCancelAfter` time, the escrow is considered expired. This means that the funds can only be returned to the sender. At the `allowExecuteAfter` time, the escrow is permitted to be released to the recipient (if the `condition` is fulfilled).

Note that `allowCancelAfter` must be chronologically later than `allowExecuteAfter`.

### Return Value

## sign

```
sign(txJSON: string, secret: string, options: object): {signedTransaction: string, id: string}
sign(txJSON: string, keypair: object, options: object): {signedTransaction: string, id: string}
```

Sign a prepared transaction. The signed transaction must subsequently be [submitted](#submit).

This method can sign any of [the transaction types supported by ripple-binary-codec](https://github.com/ripple/ripple-binary-codec/blob/cfcde79c19c359e9a0466d7bc3dc9a3aef47bb99/src/enums/definitions.json#L1637). When a new transaction type is added to the XLA Ledger, it will be unrecognized until `ripple-binary-codec` is updated. If you try to sign an unrecognized transaction type, this method throws an error similar to the following:

`Error: [TRANSACTION_TYPE] is not a valid name or ordinal for TransactionType`

### Parameters

Name | Type | Description
---- | ---- | -----------
txJSON | string | Transaction represented as a JSON string in rippled format.
keypair | object | *Optional* The private and public key of the account that is initiating the transaction. (This field cannot be used with secret).
*keypair.* privateKey | privateKey | The uppercase hexadecimal representation of the secp256k1 or Ed25519 private key.
*keypair.* publicKey | publicKey | The uppercase hexadecimal representation of the secp256k1 or Ed25519 public key.
options | object | *Optional* Options that control the type of signature that will be generated.
*options.* signAs | [address](#address) | *Optional* The account that the signature should count for in multisigning.
secret | secret string | *Optional* The secret of the account that is initiating the transaction. (This field cannot be used with keypair).

When this method is used for multisigning, the `options` parameter is required. See the multisigning example in this section for more details.

### Return Value

This method returns an object with the following structure:

Name | Type | Description
---- | ---- | -----------
signedTransaction | string | The signed transaction represented as an uppercase hexadecimal string.
id | [transactionHash](#transaction-id) | The [Transaction ID](#transaction-id) of the signed transaction.

### Example (multisigning)

```javascript
const RippleAPI = require('ripple-lib').RippleAPI;

// jon's address will have a multi-signing setup with a quorum of 2
const jon = {
    account: 'rJKpme4m2zBQceBuU89d7vLMzgoUw2Ptj',
    secret: 'sh4Va7b1wQof8knHFV2sxwX12fSgK'
};
const aya = {
    account: 'rnrPdBjs98fFFfmRpL6hM7exT788SWQPFN',
    secret: 'snaMuMrXeVc2Vd4NYvHofeGNjgYoe'
};
const bran = {
    account: 'rJ93RLnT1t5A8fCr7HTScw7WtfKJMRXodH',
    secret: 'shQtQ8Um5MS218yvEU3Ehy1eZQKqH'
};

// Setup the signers list with a quorum of 2
const multiSignSetupTransaction = {
    "Flags": 0,
    "TransactionType": "SignerListSet",
    "Account": "rJKpme4m2zBQceBuU89d7vLMzgoUw2Ptj",
    "Fee": "120",
    "SignerQuorum": 2,
    "SignerEntries": [
        {
            "SignerEntry": {
                "Account": "rnrPdBjs98fFFfmRpL6hM7exT788SWQPFN",
                "SignerWeight": 2
            }
        },
        {
            "SignerEntry": {
                "Account": "rJ93RLnT1t5A8fCr7HTScw7WtfKJMRXodH",
                "SignerWeight": 1
            }
        },
    ]
};

// a transaction which requires multi signing
const multiSignPaymentTransaction = {
    TransactionType: 'Payment',
    Account: 'rJKpme4m2zBQceBuU89d7vLMzgoUw2Ptj',
    Destination: 'rJ93RLnT1t5A8fCr7HTScw7WtfKJMRXodH',
    Amount: '88000000'
};

const api = new RippleAPI({
    server: 'wss://s1.ripplealpha.com:6005'
});

api.connect().then(() => {
    // adding the multi signing feature to jon's account
    api.prepareTransaction(multiSignSetupTransaction).then((prepared) => {
        console.log(prepared);
        jonSign = api.sign(prepared.txJSON, jon.secret).signedTransaction;
        api.submit(jonSign).then( response => {
            console.log(response.resultCode, response.resultMessage);

            // multi sign a transaction
            api.prepareTransaction(multiSignPaymentTransaction).then(prepared => {
                console.log(prepared);

                // Aya and Bran sign it too but with 'signAs' set to their own account
                let ayaSign = api.sign(prepared.txJSON, aya.secret, {'signAs': aya.account}).signedTransaction;
                let branSign = api.sign(prepared.txJSON, bran.secret, {'signAs': bran.account}).signedTransaction;

                // signatures are combined and submitted
                let combinedTx = api.combine([ayaSign, branSign]);
                api.submit(combinedTx.signedTransaction).then(response => {
                    console.log(response.tx_json.hash);
                    return api.disconnect();
                }).catch(console.error);
            }).catch(console.error);
        }).catch(console.error)
    }).catch(console.error);
}).catch(console.error);
```

Assuming the multisigning account was setup properly, the above example will respond with `resultCode: 'tesSUCCESS'` and the hash for the transaction.
If any of `{signAs: some_address}` options were missing the code will return a validation error as follow:
```
[ValidationError(txJSON is not the same for all signedTransactions)]
```

## computeLedgerHash

`computeLedgerHash(ledger: object): string`

Compute the hash of a ledger.

### Parameters

<aside class="notice">
The parameter to this method has the same structure as the return value of getLedger.
</aside>

Name | Type | Description
---- | ---- | -----------
ledger | object | The ledger header to hash.
*ledger.* stateHash | string | Hash of all state information in this ledger.
*ledger.* closeTime | date-time string | The time at which this ledger was closed.
*ledger.* closeTimeResolution | integer | Approximate number of seconds between closing one ledger version and closing the next one.
*ledger.* closeFlags | integer | A bit-map of flags relating to the closing of this ledger. Currently, the ledger has only one flag defined for `closeFlags`: **sLCF_NoConsensusTime** (value 1). If this flag is enabled, it means that validators were in conflict regarding the correct close time for the ledger, but built otherwise the same ledger, so they declared consensus while "agreeing to disagree" on the close time. In this case, the consensus ledger contains a `closeTime` value that is 1 second after that of the previous ledger. (In this case, there is no official close time, but the actual real-world close time is probably 3-6 seconds later than the specified `closeTime`.)
*ledger.* ledgerHash | string | Unique identifying hash of the entire ledger.
*ledger.* ledgerVersion | integer | The ledger version of this ledger.
*ledger.* ledgerVersion | string | The ledger version of this ledger.
*ledger.* parentLedgerHash | string | Unique identifying hash of the ledger that came immediately before this one.
*ledger.* parentCloseTime | date-time string | The time at which the previous ledger was closed.
*ledger.* totalDrops | [value](#value) | Total number of drops (1/1,000,000th of an XLA) in the network, as a quoted integer. (This decreases as transaction fees cause XLA to be destroyed.)
*ledger.* transactionHash | string | Hash of the transaction information included in this ledger.
*ledger.* rawState | string | *Optional* A JSON string containing all state data for this ledger in rippled JSON format.
*ledger.* stateHashes | array\<string\> | *Optional* An array of hashes of all state data in this ledger.
*ledger.* transactionHashes | array\<[transactionHash](#transaction-id)\> | *Optional* An array of hashes of all transactions that were validated in this ledger.
*ledger.* transactions | array\<[getTransaction](#gettransaction)\> | *Optional* Array of all transactions that were validated in this ledger. Transactions are represented in the same format as the return value of [getTransaction](#gettransaction).

### Return Value

This method returns an uppercase hexadecimal string representing the hash of the ledger.

### Example

```javascript
const ledger = {
  "stateHash": "D9ABF622DA26EEEE48203085D4BC23B0F77DC6F8724AC33D975DA3CA492D2E44",

```

## xrpToDrops

`xrpToDrops(xrp: string | BigNumber): string`

Converts an XLA amount to drops. 1 XLA = 1,000,000 drops, so 1 drop = 0.000001 XLA. This method is useful when converting amounts for use with the rippled API, which requires XLA amounts to be specified in drops.

### Parameters

`xrp`: A string or BigNumber representing an amount of XLA. If `xrp` is a string, it may start with `-`, must contain at least one number, and may contain up to one `.`. This method throws a `ValidationError` for invalid input.

### Return Value

A string representing an equivalent amount of drops.

### Example

```javascript
return api.xrpToDrops('1');
```

```json
'1000000'
```

## dropsToXrp

`dropsToXrp(drops: string | BigNumber): string`

Converts an amount of drops to XLA. 1 drop = 0.000001 XLA, so 1 XLA = 1,000,000 drops. This method is useful when converting amounts from the rippled API, which describes XLA amounts in drops.

### Parameters

`drops`: A string or BigNumber representing an amount of drops. If `drops` is a string, it may start with `-` and must contain at least one number. This method throws a `ValidationError` for invalid input.

### Return Value

A string representing an equivalent amount of XLA.

### Example

```javascript
return api.dropsToXrp('1');
```

```json
'0.000001'
```

## iso8601ToRippleTime

`iso8601ToRippleTime(iso8601: string): number`

This method parses a string representation of a date, and returns the number of seconds since the "Ripple Epoch" of January 1, 2000 (00:00 UTC).

The Ripple Epoch is 946684800 seconds after the Unix Epoch.

This method is useful for creating timestamps to use with the rippled APIs. The rippled APIs represent time as an unsigned integer of the number of seconds since the Ripple Epoch.

### Parameters

`iso8601`: A string representing a date and time. This string is parsed using JavaScript's `Date.parse()` method.

### Return Value

The number of seconds since the Ripple Epoch.

### Example

```javascript
api.iso8601ToRippleTime('2017-02-17T15:04:57Z');
```

```json
540659097
```

## rippleTimeToISO8601

`rippleTimeToISO8601(rippleTime: number): string`

This method takes the number of seconds since the "Ripple Epoch" of January 1, 2000 (00:00 UTC) and returns a string representation of a date.

The Ripple Epoch is 946684800 seconds after the Unix Epoch.

This method is useful for interpreting timestamps returned by the rippled APIs. The rippled APIs represent time as an unsigned integer of the number of seconds since the Ripple Epoch.

### Parameters

`rippleTime`: A number of seconds since the Ripple Epoch.

### Return Value

A string representing a date and time, created by calling a `Date` object's `toISOString()` method.

### Example

```javascript
api.rippleTimeToISO8601(540659097);
```

```json
'2017-02-17T15:04:57.000Z'
```

## txFlags

`txFlags.TRANSACTION_TYPE.FLAG`

This object provides constants for use when creating or interpreting transaction flags. Most transactions have a set of bit-flags that represent various options that affect how a transaction should behave. These options are represented as binary values that can be combined with bitwise-or operations to encode multiple flags at once.

Most flags only have meaning for a specific transaction type. The same bitwise value may be reused for flags on different transaction types, so it is important to pay attention to the transaction type when setting and reading flags.

Bits that are not defined as flags MUST be 0.

### Global Flag

Applies globally to all transactions.

`txFlags.Universal.FullyCanonicalSig`: Require a fully-canonical signature. When preparing transactions, ripple-lib enables this flag for you.

### Payment Flags

`txFlags.Payment.NoRippleDirect`: Do not use the default path; only use specified paths. This is intended to force the transaction to take arbitrage opportunities. Most clients do not need this.

`txFlags.Payment.PartialPayment`: If the specified destination amount cannot be sent without spending more than the source maxAmount, reduce the received amount instead of failing outright. See [Partial Payments](https://developers.ripple.com/partial-payments.html) for more details.

`txFlags.Payment.LimitQuality`: Only take paths where all the conversions have an input:output ratio that is equal or better than the ratio of `destination.amount`:`source.maxAmount`. See [Limit Quality](https://developers.ripple.com/payment.html#limit-quality) for details.

### OfferCreate Flags

`txFlags.OfferCreate.Passive`: If enabled, the offer does not consume offers that exactly match it, and instead becomes an Offer object in the ledger. It still consumes offers that cross it.

`txFlags.OfferCreate.ImmediateOrCancel`: Treat the offer as an Immediate or Cancel order. If enabled, the offer never becomes a ledger object: it only tries to match existing offers in the ledger.

`txFlags.OfferCreate.FillOrKill`: Treat the offer as a Fill or Kill order.

`txFlags.OfferCreate.Sell`: Treat the offer as a Sell order. With `order.direction = 'sell'`, exchange the entire `order.quantity`, even if it means obtaining more than the `order.totalPrice` amount in exchange. If using `prepareOrder`, ripple-lib sets this flag for you.

### TrustSet Flags

`txFlags.TrustSet.SetAuth`: Authorize the other party to hold issuances from this account. (No effect unless using the AccountSet.RequireAuth flag.) Cannot be unset.

`txFlags.TrustSet.NoRipple`:  Obsolete.

`txFlags.TrustSet.SetNoRipple`: Blocks [rippling](https://developers.ripple.com/rippling.html) between two trustlines of the same currency, if this flag is set on both.

`txFlags.TrustSet.ClearNoRipple`: Clears the No-[Rippling](https://developers.ripple.com/rippling.html) flag.

`txFlags.TrustSet.SetFreeze`: Freeze the trustline. A non-XLA currency can be frozen by the exchange or gateway that issued it. XLA cannot be frozen.

`txFlags.TrustSet.ClearFreeze`: Unfreeze the trustline.

### AccountSet Flags

You can use the `prepareSettings` method to change your account flags. This method uses AccountSet flags internally.

In the rippled API, Account Flags can be enabled and disabled with the SetFlag and ClearFlag parameters. See [AccountSet Flags](https://developers.ripple.com/accountset.html#accountset-flags).

The AccountSet transaction type has some transaction flags, but their use is discouraged.

* `txFlags.AccountSet.RequireDestTag`
* `txFlags.AccountSet.OptionalDestTag`
* `txFlags.AccountSet.RequireAuth`
* `txFlags.AccountSet.OptionalAuth`
* `txFlags.AccountSet.DisallowXRP`
* `txFlags.AccountSet.AllowXRP`

### PaymentChannelClaim Flags

`txFlags.PaymentChannelClaim.Renew`: Clear the channel's Expiration time. (Expiration is different from the channel's immutable CancelAfter time.) Only the source address of the payment channel can use this flag.

`txFlags.PaymentChannelClaim.Close`: Request to close the channel. Only the channel source and destination addresses can use this flag. This flag closes the channel immediately if it has no more XLA allocated to it after processing the current claim, or if the destination address uses it. If the source address uses this flag when the channel still holds XLA, this schedules the channel to close after SettleDelay seconds have passed. (Specifically, this sets the Expiration of the channel to the close time of the previous ledger plus the channel's SettleDelay time, unless the channel already has an earlier Expiration time.) If the destination address uses this flag when the channel still holds XLA, any XLA that remains after processing the claim is returned to the source address.

### Other Transaction Types

The remaining transaction types do not have any flags at this time.

* OfferCancel
* SetRegularKey
* SignerListSet
* EscrowCreate
* EscrowFinish
* EscrowCancel
* PaymentChannelCreate
* PaymentChannelFund

## schemaValidator

Unlike the rest of the ripple-lib API, schemaValidator is a static object on RippleAPI. It provides utility methods that do not use a server.

## schemaValidate

`RippleAPI.schemaValidator.schemaValidate(schemaName: string, object: any): void`

This method checks an object for conformance to a specified schema. It does not return anything, but will throw a `ValidationError` if the object does not conform to the schema.

### Example

If the object is valid (conforms to the schema), nothing is returned. Otherwise, `schemaValidate` throws an error:

```javascript
RippleAPI.schemaValidator.schemaValidate('sign', {
    signedTransaction: '12000322800000002400000017201B0086955368400000000000000C732102F89EAEC7667B30F33D0687BBA86C3FE2A08CCA40A9186C5BDE2DAA6FA97A37D874473045022100BDE09A1F6670403F341C21A77CF35BA47E45CDE974096E1AA5FC39811D8269E702203D60291B9A27F1DCABA9CF5DED307B4F23223E0B6F156991DB601DFB9C41CE1C770A726970706C652E636F6D81145E7B112523F68D2F5E879DB4EAC51C6698A69304',

## error

This event is emitted when there is an error on the connection to the server that cannot be associated to a specific request.

### Return Value

The first parameter is a string indicating the error type:
* `badMessage` - rippled returned a malformed message
* `websocket` - the websocket library emitted an error
* one of the error codes found in the [rippled Universal Errors](https://ripple.com/build/rippled-apis/#universal-errors).

The second parameter is a message explaining the error.

The third parameter is:
* the message that caused the error for `badMessage`
* the error object emitted for `websocket`
* the parsed response for rippled errors

### Example

```javascript
api.on('error', (errorCode, errorMessage, data) => {
  console.log(errorCode + ': ' + errorMessage);
});
```

```
tooBusy: The server is too busy to help you now.
```

## connected

This event is emitted after connection successfully opened.

### Example

```javascript
api.on('connected', () => {
  console.log('Connection is open now.');
});
```

## disconnected

This event is emitted when connection is closed.

### Return Value

The only parameter is a number containing the [close code](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CloseEvent) send by the server.

### Example

```javascript
api.on('disconnected', (code) => {
  if (code !== 1000) {
    console.log('Connection is closed due to error.');
  } else {
    console.log('Connection is closed normally.');
  }
});
```
