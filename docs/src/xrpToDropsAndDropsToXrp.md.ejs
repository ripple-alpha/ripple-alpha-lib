## xrpToDrops

`xrpToDrops(xrp: string | BigNumber): string`

Converts an XRP amount to drops. 1 XRP = 1,000,000 drops, so 1 drop = 0.000001 XRP. This method is useful when converting amounts for use with the rippled API, which requires XRP amounts to be specified in drops.

### Parameters

`xrp`: A string or BigNumber representing an amount of XRP. If `xrp` is a string, it may start with `-`, must contain at least one number, and may contain up to one `.`. This method throws a `ValidationError` for invalid input.

### Return Value

A string representing an equivalent amount of drops.

### Example

```javascript
return api.xrpToDrops('1');
```

```json
'1000000'
```
